leetcode:- 3803. Count Residue Prefixes

ques:-  You are given a string s consisting only of lowercase English letters.

A prefix of s is called a residue if the number of distinct characters in the prefix is equal to len(prefix) % 3.
Return the count of residue prefixes in s.
A prefix of a string is a non-empty substring that starts from the beginning of the string and extends to any point within it.

Example 1:

Input: s = "abc"
Output: 2
Explanation:​​​​​​​

Prefix "a" has 1 distinct character and length modulo 3 is 1, so it is a residue.
Prefix "ab" has 2 distinct characters and length modulo 3 is 2, so it is a residue.
Prefix "abc" does not satisfy the condition. Thus, the answer is 2.

approach:-

class Solution {
public:
    int residuePrefixes(string s) {
        int n=s.size();
        int hash[26]={0};
        int count=0;
        int distinct=0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(hash[s[i]-'a']==0){
                distinct++;
            }
            hash[s[i]-'a']++;
            int length=i+1;
            if(distinct==(length)%3){
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
