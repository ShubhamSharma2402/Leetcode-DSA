Explanation:
We have to create a hash array of size 26 (for 26 characters), and it was specified that
it contains only lowercase letters. thats why we use hash[s[i]-'a'] to map 'a' to 0, 'b' to 1 and so on.
if it was not given we would have taken hash[256] to cover all ASCII characters. 
and instead of hash[c-'a'], we would have used hash[c] directly.
