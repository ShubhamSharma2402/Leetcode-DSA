leetcode:-167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted
ques:-
Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that 
they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.

Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.
The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.
Your solution must use only constant extra space.

Example 1:

Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].

approach:-
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& numbers, int target) {
        int n=numbers.size();
        int left=0;
        int right=n-1;
        while(right>left){
            int sum=numbers[right]+numbers[left];
            if(sum==target){
                return {left+1,right+1};
            }
            else if(sum>target){
                right--;
            }
            else{
                left++;
            }
        }
      
        return {};
    }
};

leetcode:- 977. Squares of a Sorted Array
ques:-
Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].

approach:-
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> sortedSquares(vector<int>& nums) {
       int n=nums.size();
        vector<int>arr(n);
       int left=0;
       int right=n-1;
       int indexx=n-1;
       while(right>=left){
        if(abs(nums[right])>abs(nums[left])){
           arr[indexx]=nums[right]*nums[right];
           right--;
           indexx--;
        }
        else{
            arr[indexx]=nums[left]*nums[left];
            left++;
            indexx--;
        }
       }
       return arr;
    }
};

leetcode:-11. Container With Most Water
ques:-
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are
 (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
Notice that you may not slant the container.

example:-1  Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of
 water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

 approach:-
 class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int n=height.size();
        int left=0;
        int right=n-1;
        int maxx=0;
        while(right>left){
            if(height[left]<height[right]){
                maxx=max(maxx,height[left]*(right-left));
                left++;
            }
            else{
                maxx=max(maxx,height[right]*(right-left));
                right--;
            }
        }
        return maxx;
    }
};
