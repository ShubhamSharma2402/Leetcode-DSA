🔹 Pattern 6: Greedy Two Pointers
👉 Pair largest with smallest

🔍 Step-by-Step Intuition:-

1️⃣ Sort the array if problem involves maximizing/minimizing total using pairs
2️⃣ Use one pointer at the start and one at the end
3️⃣ Decide greedily: pick largest + smallest, or two largest, depending on problem
4️⃣ Update result
5️⃣ Move pointers according to the rule

881. Boats to Save People

leetcode:-881. Boats to Save People
ques:-
You are given an array people where people[i] is the weight of the ith person, and an infinite number of boats where each boat can 
carry a maximum weight of limit. Each boat carries at most two people at the same time, provided the sum of the weight of those people 
is at most limit.

Return the minimum number of boats to carry every given person.

Example 1:
Input: people = [1,2], limit = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 boat (1, 2)

approach:-

class Solution {
public:
    int numRescueBoats(vector<int>& people, int limit) {
        sort(people.begin(),people.end());
        int n=people.size();
        int left=0;
        int right=n-1;
        int ans=0;
        while(right>=left){
            int sum=people[left]+people[right];
            if(sum>limit){
                ans++;
                right--;
            }
            else{
                ans++;
                left++;
                right--;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
