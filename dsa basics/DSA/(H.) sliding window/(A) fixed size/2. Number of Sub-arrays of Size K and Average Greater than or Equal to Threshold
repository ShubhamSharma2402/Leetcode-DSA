leetcode:-1343. Number of Sub-arrays of Size K and Average Greater than or Equal to Threshold

ques:-
Given an array of integers arr and two integers k and threshold, return the number of s
ub-arrays of size k and average greater than or equal to threshold.

Example 1:

Input: arr = [2,2,2,2,5,5,5,8], k = 3, threshold = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: Sub-arrays [2,5,5],[5,5,5] and [5,5,8] have averages 4, 5 and 6 respectively.
 All other sub-arrays of size 3 have averages less than 4 (the threshold).

 approach:-

 class Solution {
public:
    int numOfSubarrays(vector<int>& arr, int k, int threshold) {
       int window_sum=0;
       int max_sum=INT_MIN;
       int target=threshold*k;
       int count=0;
       for(int i=0;i<arr.size();i++){
        window_sum+=arr[i];
        if(i>=(k-1)){
            if(window_sum>=target){
                count++;
            }
            window_sum-=arr[i-(k-1)];
        }
       } 
       return count;
    }
};
