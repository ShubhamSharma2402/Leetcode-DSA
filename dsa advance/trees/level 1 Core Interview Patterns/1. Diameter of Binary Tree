leetcode:- 543. Diameter of Binary Tree

ques:-
Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.
The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. 
This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

approach:-

class Solution {
public:
int diameter=0;
int height(TreeNode* root){
    if(root==NULL) return 0;
    int left=height(root->left);
    int right=height(root->right);
    diameter=max(diameter,left+right);
    return 1+ max(left,right);
}
    int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode* root) {
      height(root);
      return diameter;
    }
};
