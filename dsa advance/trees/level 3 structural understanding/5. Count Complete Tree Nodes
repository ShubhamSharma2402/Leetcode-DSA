leetcode:- 222. Count Complete Tree Nodes

ques:-
Given the root of a complete binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.

According to Wikipedia, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the 
last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

Design an algorithm that runs in less than O(n) time complexity.

approach:-

class Solution {
public:
    int leftheight(TreeNode* root){
    int h=0;
    while(root!=NULL){
        h++;
        root=root->left;
    }
    return h;
    }
    int rightheight(TreeNode* root){
    int h=0;
    while(root!=NULL){
        h++;
        root=root->right;
    }
    return h;
    }
    int countNodes(TreeNode* root) {
        if(root==NULL){
        return 0;
        }
        int lh=leftheight(root);
        int rh=rightheight(root);
        if(lh==rh){
            return(1<<lh)-1;
        }
        return 1+countNodes(root->left)+countNodes(root->right);
    }
};
