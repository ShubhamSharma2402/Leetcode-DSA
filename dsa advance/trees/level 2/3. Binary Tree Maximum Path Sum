leetcode:- 124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum

ques:-
A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. 
A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.
Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.

approach:-

class Solution {
public: 
int maxSum=INT_MIN;
    int dfs(TreeNode* root){
        if(root==NULL) return 0;

  //Best path ending at this node
        int left=max(0,dfs(root->left));
        int right=max(0,dfs(root->right));
        
  //Best path going upward
        maxSum=max(maxSum,left+right+root->val);
        return root->val + max(left,right);
    }
    int maxPathSum(TreeNode* root) {
       dfs(root);
        return maxSum;
    }
};
