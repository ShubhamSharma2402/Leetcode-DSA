leetcode:- 129. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers

ques:- You are given the root of a binary tree containing digits from 0 to 9 only.
Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.

For example, the root-to-leaf path 1 -> 2 -> 3 represents the number 123.
Return the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.
A leaf node is a node with no children.

approach:-

class Solution {
public:
    int dfs(TreeNode* root,int curr){
        if(root==NULL) return 0;
        curr=curr*10+root->val;

        if(root->left==NULL && root->right==NULL){
            return curr;
        }
        return dfs(root->left,curr)+ dfs(root->right,curr);
    }
    int sumNumbers(TreeNode* root) {
        return dfs(root,0);
    }
};
