leetcode:- 111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree

ques:-
Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.
The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

approach:-

class Solution {
public:
    int minDepth(TreeNode* root) {
         if(root==NULL) return 0;
        int left=minDepth(root->left);
        int right=minDepth(root->right);
        if(root->left==NULL){
            return 1+right;
        }
        if(root->right==NULL){
            return 1+left;
        }
        return 1+min(left,right);
    }
};
